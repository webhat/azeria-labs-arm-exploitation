===============

These are the examples with (these labs)[https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/]



## Play along
You can compile the code with:
```
  gcc -c file.s && ld file.o && ./a.out
```
or
```
  gcc -nostdlib file.s && ./a.out
```
or
```
  as file.s -o file.o
  ld file.o -o file
```

And you need to install the gef extention for gdb:
```
  wget -O ~/.gdbinit-gef.py -q https://github.com/hugsy/gef/raw/master/gef.py\n
  echo source ~/.gdbinit-gef.py >> ~/.gdbinit

```

## NOTE
If in `gdb` you get the error: `terminate called after throwing an instance of 'gdb_exception_RETURN_MASK_ERROR'` you are runnin an old version of gdb, instoall 8.2 or higher.

```
wget "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-8.2.tar.gz"
tar -xvzf gdb-8.2.tar.gz
cd gdb-8.2/
./configure --with-python
make
sudo make install
```
