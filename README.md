These are the examples with (these labs)[https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/]



## Play along
You can compile the code with:
```
  gcc -c part2.s && ld part2.o && ./a.out
```
or
```
  gcc -nostdlib hello.s && ./a.out
```

And you need to install the gef extention for gdb
```
  wget -O ~/.gdbinit-gef.py -q https://github.com/hugsy/gef/raw/master/gef.py\n
  echo source ~/.gdbinit-gef.py >> ~/.gdbinit

```
